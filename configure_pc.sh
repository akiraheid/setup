#    # Regardless of how dynamic your network environment may be, it is still
#    # useful to be familiar with the general idea behind each of the predefined
#    # zones for firewalld. In order from least trusted to most trusted, the
#    # predefined zones within firewalld are:
#    # drop: Any incoming network packets are dropped, there is no reply. Only
#    #       outgoing network connections are possible.
#    # block: Any incoming network connections are rejected with an
#    #        icmp-host-prohibited message for IPv4 and icmp6-adm-prohibited
#    #        for IPv6. Only network connections initiated within this system
#    #        are possible.
#    # public: For use in public areas. You do not trust the other computers on
#    #         networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming
#    #         connections are accepted.
#    # external: For use on external networks with IPv4 masquerading enabled
#    #           especially for routers. You do not trust the other computers on
#    #           networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming
#    #           connections are accepted.
#    # dmz: For computers in your demilitarized zone that are publicly-accessible
#    #      with limited access to your internal network. Only selected incoming
#    #      connections are accepted.
#    # work: For use in work areas. You mostly trust the other computers on
#    #       networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming
#    #       connections are accepted.
#    # home: For use in home areas. You mostly trust the other computers on
#    #       networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming
#    #       connections are accepted.
#    # internal: For use on internal networks. You mostly trust the other
#    #           computers on the networks to not harm your computer. Only
#    #           selected incoming connections are accepted.
#    # trusted: All network connections are accepted.
